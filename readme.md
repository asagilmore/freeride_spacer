# Freeride Spacer

![Freeride Spacer](./render.PNG)

This is a freeride spacer for making lightweight tech bindings ski a bit better. Similar to those used
on ATK bindings, but capable of fitting under low
stack height bindings, as low as 6.5mm.

## Order instructions

Any CNC service can be used, but [JLC CNC](https://jlccnc.com/) is what I used, and tends to be the cheapest.

To order, first measure your stack height with your boot+ binding combo, and then select the spacer file with a stack height greater than, but closest to your measured height. It is fairly easy to sand down the plastic spacer to get a perfect fit, but hard to add material later.

If you are handy with CAD software it should be easy to modify any of the spacer files to get a perfect fit, note that the base adds 2.5mm on top of the height of the spacer, which is accounted for in the file names.

Then go to JLC CNC and upload the spacer.step file + the base.step file.

For the base use these settings, (make sure you add the drawing.pdf file below the roughness option!):

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| CNC file | base.step |
| Qty | 2 |
| Material | Aluminum 6061 |
| Surface Finish | No |
| Tightest Tolerance | ISO 2768 medium |
| Smallest Roughness | Ra1.6 |
| Threads | No |
| Sub-assembly | No |
| Product Desc | Aluminum Alloy Rectangular Plate |


For the spacer use these settings:
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| CNC file | spacer_(pick size).step |
| Qty | 2 |
| Material | POM(White) |
| Surface Finish | No |
| Tightest Tolerance | ISO 2768 medium |
| Smallest Roughness | Ra3.2 |
| Threads | No |
| Sub-assembly | No |
| Product Desc | Plastic Irregular Board |

Now you should be all set to order!

## Assembly

Each spacer uses 2x M5 flat head screws, and about 10cm of 2mm [shock cord](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088QLQL27?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1).

The spacers will likely not fit out of the box, as its hard to dial in the tolerances without ordering alot of different spacers, so just sand/scrape the sides until it slides with relativly low friction.

Then just measure and drill two holes (4.2mm), and screw in the base with epoxy/wood glue in the holes.
I would recommend applying some grease, I used Vaseline, between the base and spacer to reduce icing.
Now just insert the spacer and loop though the shock cord and tie it off. Now you should be good to ski!
